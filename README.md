# Google Photos Dark Data Auditor 

#Purpose
This project is a technical exploration into Data Minimalism. As a Computer Engineering student interested in sustainability, I am developing this tool to help users identify "Dark Data "forgotten, unorganized media that consumes energy and cloud resources.

Technical Implementation
- OAuth2 Flow: Implemented using Flask to handle secure user authentication.
- Google Photos Library API: Utilized to fetch and filter media items.
- Python: Core logic for data retrieval and session management.

##  Current Status: Work in Progress
- [x] OAuth2 Authentication with Flask
- [x] Basic Media Item listing
- [ ] Integration of Green Algorithm carbon-offset metrics
- [ ] Automated "Blurry/Duplicate" detection using ML
